# Aim and Scope of the Project
For the purpose of having a more accurate analysis of the diagnosis of the erythemato-squamous disease, we first reviewed the histological characteristics of the diseases, and then we used Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor to exclude outlier data from the dataset. We find a threshold value using this approach for better outlier removal and the result was then tested. 
A dataset on dermatology containing 34 attributes, 33 of which are linear valued and one of them nominal was obtained from OpenML. 
In the said dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicates the relative intermediate values.

# Research Objectives
1.	To assess how well different machine learning algorithms perform when used to diagnose and analyse erythemato-squamous disease
2.	To anticipate the erythemato-squamous disease differential diagnosis
3.	To predict the presence of erythemato-squamous disease using machine learning approach
